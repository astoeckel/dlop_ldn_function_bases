## Usage

First of all, if you want to integrate parts of this code into your own project, feel free to just copy-paste the portionts of the code you'll need.

If you don't want to do this, simply install this package via `pip`. For example, run

```sh
pip3 install --user -e .
```

Depending on your environment, you may need to use `pip` instead of `pip3`. Also, if you're inside a virtual environment, you may have to skip the `--user` argument.

After installation, you can simply import the `dlop_ldn_function_bases` package into your Python script. For example, the following Python code will generate a DLOP basis with *q* = 6 and *N* = 20.
```python
import dlop_ldn_function_bases as bases

bases.mk_dlop_basis(q=6, N=20)
```

Passing the array returned by one of the `mk_*_basis` functions through `lowpass_filter_basis` will ensure the the incomding `N` samples are optimally low-pass filtered to be represented by *q* = 6 (Fourier) coefficients.
